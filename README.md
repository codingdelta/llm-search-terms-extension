# LLM Search Terms Extension üîç

**LLM Search Terms Plugin** is a _free browser extension_ that captures and displays the search terms from ChatGPT conversations as they stream in.

**LLMs are starting to take market share from traditional search engines.** Next to ranking in traditional search engines, it becomes important to rank well in LLMs, like **ChatGPT**, **Perplexity**, **Gemini**, etc.

Therefore, it is important to know what search terms LLMs use to find information. This extension captures the search terms from ChatGPT conversations and displays them in a popup. This allows you to better understand the way **ChatGPT searches the web** and adjust your content accordingly.

A small popup will appear in the top right corner of the screen with the search terms ChatGPT used:
